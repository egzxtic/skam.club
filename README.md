# FiveM: SKAM.CLUB

This repository contains a full server package for FiveM, developed as part of a now-closed project. As the owner of this project, I have decided to make the entire package publicly available for anyone to use, modify, or learn from.

## Notes
- This package is provided "as-is" without any active support or updates.
- Feel free to modify the files as needed to fit your server's requirements.
- Make sure to review the scripts and configurations to ensure compatibility with the latest FiveM updates.
